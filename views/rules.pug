      li Picnic rules apply.

    h2(style='color:whitesmoke') Passing:
    ul
      li There is no "hold" hand. The passes go left, across, right, then back to left.

    h2(style='color:whitesmoke') Playing:
    ul
      li The player to the left of the dealer starts with any card he/she choses
      li Hearts is "broken" right from the get-go
      li If you shoot the moon you can go down 26 or push everyone else up 26
      li You can look at the last trick that was played TODO

    h2(style='color:whitesmoke') TODOs:
    ul
      li make option available to go down 26 rather than always push everyone else up 26 (& make sure pushing everyone else up 26 works)
      li make mechanism to see last trick that was played
      li show pass direction in current round
      li remove current round scores?
